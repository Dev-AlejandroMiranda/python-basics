### 5. loops.py ⭐ NEW!
Master Python loops and iteration:
- For loops with range()
- Iterating over sequences (strings, lists)
- While loops
- Loop control statements (break, continue, pass)
- Nested loops
- Loop with else clause
- Enumerate for index tracking

**Topics covered:**
- Different types of loops
