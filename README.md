## 🎯 Modules

### 1. variables.py
Learn the fundamentals of Python variables:
- Variable declaration with type hints
- Basic data types (str, int, float, bool)
- User input handling
- Type casting and conversions
- Simple calculations

**Topics covered:**
- String, integer, float, and boolean types
- The `type()` function
- Input and output operations
- Converting between data types

### 2. control_flow.py
Master control flow structures in Python:
- if/elif/else statements
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditions
- Conditional expressions (ternary operator)

**Topics covered:**
- Decision making in programs
- Multiple conditions with elif
- Combining conditions with logical operators
- Range checking and validation
- Error handling with try/except

### 3. functions.py
Master Python functions:
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and return values
- Default parameters
- Keyword arguments
- Variable arguments (*args, **kwargs)
- Lambda functions
- Nested functions
- Practical examples

**Topics covered:**
- Creating reusable code blocks
- Function parameters and type hints
- Multiple return values with tuples
- Flexible function arguments
- Anonymous functions with lambda
- Real-world function applications
- Interactive calculator example

### 4. lists.py
Explore Python lists and their operations:
- Creating and initializing lists
- Indexing (positive and negative)
- List slicing with various patterns
- Adding and removing elements
- List methods (append, insert, remove, pop, sort, reverse)
- List comprehensions
- Nested lists (2D arrays)
- Copying lists correctly

**Topics covered:**
- Dynamic arrays in Python
- List manipulation techniques
- Efficient list operations
- Common list functions (min, max, sum, sorted)
- Interactive list building

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system
- Basic understanding of command line/terminal

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-AlejandroMiranda/python-basics.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd python-basics
```

3. Navigate to the exercises folder:
```bash
cd exercises
```

### Running the Modules

Execute each module individually to see the examples:

```bash
# Run variables module
python exercises/variables.py

# Run control flow module
python exercises/control_flow.py

# Run functions module
python exercises/functions.py

# Run lists module
python exercises/lists.py
```

Or navigate to the exercises folder first:
```bash
cd exercises
python variables.py
python control_flow.py
python functions.py
python lists.py
```

Each module includes interactive examples that will prompt you for input.
